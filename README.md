# Decentralized Funding Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity-based smart contract that enables decentralized funding. Users can contribute tokens to the contract for various purposes, and the contract owner has the ability to withdraw the accumulated funds. The project is built using the Hardhat development environment and leverages the Ethers.js library for seamless interaction with Ethereum networks.

Key features:
- User-friendly token contribution mechanism
- Secure fund withdrawal for the contract owner
- Built with Hardhat for robust smart contract development
- Utilizes Ethers.js for efficient Ethereum interaction
